MVP stands for Minimum Viable Product. It's a concept in software development that emphasizes creating a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and gather feedback for future development. In other words, the goal of an MVP is to build the simplest version of a product that still delivers value to users.

The idea behind MVP is to avoid spending excessive time and resources on building a product that may not meet the needs of users or the market. By releasing a basic version of the product and gathering feedback from early adopters, developers can validate their assumptions, identify problems, and iterate on the product based on real-world feedback.

An MVP may lack some features that are planned for future releases, but it should still be usable and provide value to early adopters. The focus should be on creating a product that solves a real problem for a specific audience, rather than trying to create a product that has every possible feature.

MVPs are often associated with startups, but they can be used by any organization or team looking to validate a product or idea quickly and efficiently. By starting with an MVP, teams can save time and resources, minimize risk, and ensure that their final product meets the needs of their users.
