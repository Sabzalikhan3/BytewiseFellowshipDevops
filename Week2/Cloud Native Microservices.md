Cloud-native microservices refer to an application design strategy in which developers divide applications into a series of discrete units, called microservices. Each microservice can typically operate independently of the others, but the microservices share data and interact over a network to enable application functionality.

By using cloud native microservices, organizations can take advantage of the benefits of the cloud, such as elastic scalability, automatic failover, and easy deployment across multiple regions. They can also use tools like containerization and orchestration to simplify deployment and management.

**Microservices pros and cons**
Cloud-native microservices offer several benefits, including:

**Agility**. Applications that run as a set of distributed microservices are more flexible because developers can update and scale each microservice independently.
**Resilience**. Microservices applications tend to be more resilient because the failure of a single microservice won't usually cause the entire application to fail.
**Development simplicity**. Microservices usually break codebases into smaller parts that are easier for developers to work with.
On the other hand, microservices pose some challenges. The biggest is that they increase application complexity. An application with more moving parts is more difficult to orchestrate.

For this reason, it's often not worth implementing microservices for relatively simple applications. These include applications with small codebases, and those with minor scalability or resiliency demands.

Overall, cloud native microservices enable organizations to build and deploy applications more quickly and with greater flexibility, making it easier to adapt to changing business needs and deliver value to customers.
