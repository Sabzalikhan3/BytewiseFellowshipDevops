Taylorism, also known as scientific management, is a management theory developed by Frederick Winslow Taylor in the late 19th century. The theory aimed to improve productivity and efficiency in the workplace by breaking down tasks into smaller, specialized tasks, and then optimizing each step to eliminate any unnecessary or inefficient movements. Taylor believed that by applying scientific principles to work processes, managers could increase worker productivity and reduce costs. However, Taylorism has been criticized for its focus on efficiency at the expense of worker well-being and for reducing workers to mere cogs in a machine.
